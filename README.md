Those are just my project submission for the nand2tetris course which you can access at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Nothing fancy.

##UFAZ Project
The aim of this project was to create a simple animation in the CPU Emulator Screen. To do that, we had to use Hack Assembly
In the binary.py file you can find the automatization script for writing assembly code (The final project's .asm file is assembly.asm, which has approximately 28 000 lines of code ðŸ¥´
To use the automatization, simply find an image, transform it into binary, put it in a CSV file and divide the zeros and ones in columns of binary numbers of word length 16.
